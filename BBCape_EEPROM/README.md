Description
-----------
BBCape_EEPROM Generator is a simple tool to easily generate EEPROM files for BeagleBone Capes. The application follows a simple user interface similar to fdisk effectively supporting easy scripting.

Currently Implemented Commands
------------------------------
Latest version implementes the following commands:

q         : Quit<br>
d         : Dumps current  EEPROM content<br>
b	  : Add board info<br>
c	  : Configure pins<br>
w [fname] : Write EEPROM to file<br>

On board info mode the following commands are available:

u		 Back to general commands<br>
p		 Print Cape info<br>
1		 Set Cape Name<br>
2		 Set Cape Version<br>
3		 Set Cape Manufacturer<br>
4		 Set Cape Part Number<br>
5		 Set Cape Serial Number<br>


On Hardware configuration mode the following commands are available:

u		 Back to general commands<br>
q		 Quit<br>
l		 List Hardware Interfaces<br>
a		 Add Hardware Interfaces<br>
d		 Delete Hardware Interfaces<br>
w		 Generate DTS file<br>

Current hardware interfaces supported are:
